From this table we can see that the senior positions have a large number of employees retiring.

- 2/3 of employees retiring are Senior Engineers & Senior Staff
- Only 1549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program. 
- There are more people retiring than there are potential mentors.
- Pewlett-Hackard needs a strategic plan to prepare for the "silver tsunami".


## Summary

In order to prepare for the retirment of a large group of employees we need to determine if employees will retire based on the retirement age. The initial analysis showcases employees between a certain date of birth 1952 -1955. While it is a good plan to have a mentorship program, the 4 years they will have between the large levels of retiements is not going to be enough for the number of employees they need to replace. The hiring process should be stated well before the 4 years of retiring employees is due to occur. Based on the number of employees needing to retire Pewlett Hackard needs to look into a 10 year plan of preparation. 

-It is possible for PH to create a graph earlier on and test out the mentorship program. They will be able to determine any issues that arise and prepare for the "silver tsunami".
-Secondly, a query that gives a list of people retiring and eligible current employees that could be mentored and moved up to the role could proove useful.
